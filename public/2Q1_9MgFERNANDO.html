      <h1> The Three Dimensions of Minecraft </h1>
      <h2> Ores, Structures, Blocks and Biome </h2>

        <p> Minecraft has two pocket dimensions completely separate from your peaceful spawn place, the Overworld: there is a land filled boiling lava known as the Nether, 
            and galactic islands floating over a dark void called the End. The Overworld contains a diverse number of biomes such as Taiga Forests, Ice Spikes, Dark Oak Forests,
            Deserts and Jungles. There are also many structures such as Villages, Desert Temples, Igloos, Mansions and Jungle Temples. Many resources are mined through ores such as 
            Iron, Diamond, Emerald and Gold. </p>
