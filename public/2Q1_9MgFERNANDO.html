        <h2> Background to the 3 Dimensions:  </h2>
            <p> Minecraft has two pocket dimensions completely separate from your peaceful spawn place, the Overworld: 
                there is a land filled boiling lava known as the Nether, and galactic islands floating over a dark void called the End. </p>
                
    <!--Overworld Segment-->                

            <article> 
                <h2> The Overworld </h2> 
                    <h3> Biomes </h3>
                        <p> The Overworld contains a diverse number of biomes such as Taiga Forests, Ice Spikes, Dark Oak Forests,
                        Deserts and Jungles. </p>

                    <h3> Structures </h3>
                        <p> There are also many structures such as Villages, Desert Temples, Igloos, Mansions and Jungle Temples. </p> 

                    <h3> Ores </h3>
                        <p> Many resources are mined through ores such as Iron, Diamond, Emerald and Gold. </p>

                    <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                        <p> While there are not any Main bosses in the Overworld, there are some optional sub-bosses due to their immense strength 
                            and high health points. These bosses include: </p>

                            <ol> 
                                <li> 
                                    <b> The Warden </b>
                                        <p> Found in the Deep Dark is the Warden, a monster who relies on sound to find and destroy the player with
                                        high damages smashes and a long ranged sonic boom that pierces through blocks, as well as being very durable. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li> 
                                    <b> The Elder Guardian </b> 
                                        <p> On the other hand, the Elder Guardian is found in Ocean Monumments, protecting its treasures of gold blocks. 
                                        It applies as special status effect - mining fatigue - on the player to reduce their speed in breaking blocks, as well as 
                                        being able to shoot lasers from its eyes. </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                <h2> The Nether </h2> 
                    <h3> Background on The Nether </h3>
                        <p> The Nether can be accessed by building a nether portal in the overworld, creating a 4 block wide, 5 block tall 
                            outline of Obsidian and lighting it with a fire source, whether a fire charge, burning wood, or flint and steel. </p>

                    <h3> Biomes </h3>
                        <p> The Nether also contains a diverse number of biomes such as Warped Forests, Crimson Forests, 
                            Basalt Deltas and Soul Sand Valleys. </p>

                    <h3> Structures </h3>
                        <p> Some structures in the Nether include the Bastion Remnants and Nether Fortresses. </p> 

                    <h3> Ores </h3>
                        <p> You can find Quartz Ores and Ancient Debris. </p>

                    <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> 
                                <b> The Wither </b>
                                    <p> By placing 4 blocks of Soul Sand in a 'T' shape, and three Wither Skeleton Skulls at each top block, the player can summon a powerful
                                        entity known as the Wither. Having its own health bar, the Wither (in Minecraft Java Edition) can fly and shoots Wither Skull Projectiles 
                                        at the player that explode on contact. It also has a second phase that makes it invulnerable to projectiles. Upon defeating it, the player
                                        will gain a Nether Star and a Wither Rose.</p>
                            </li>

    <!--End Segment-->
            <article> 
                <h2> The End </h2>
                    <h3> Background on The End </h3>
                        <p> The End Portal is accessed through the End Portal located in the Stronghold- underground dungeons with a room 
                            containing a 5x5 block portal- where you can place Eyes of Ender (a combination of Ender Pearls and Blaze Powder) 
                            to ignite a portal. </p>

                    <h3> Biomes and Ores </h3>
                        <p> Compared to the previous dimensions, the End is quite bare since it only has two biomes- 
                            the Outer End and Main End Island, as well as not having any ores. </p>

                    <h3> Structures </h3>
                        <p> The only structure in the end is the End City, floating towers that contain many loot such as diamonds and even an ELytra on an End Ship
                            that allow the player to fly. However, the treasures are all guarded by Shulkers, boxes containing entities that shoot projectiles that make 
                            the player float in the air. </p> 

                    <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                <b> The Ender Dragon </b> 
                                    <p> Being the final boss of Minecraft, the Ender Dragon flies around the Main End island, spits fire balls that create a lingering damage effect, and 
                                        swoops down and physically attacks and launches the player high in the air. There are also End Crystals sitting atop Obsidian pillars that allow 
                                        it to quickly regenerate its health. After destroying the crystals and defeating the Ender Dragon, it will drop many Experience Points and a Dragon Egg
                                        that sits on the Bedrock fountain, waiting to be collected by the player. </p>
                            </li>

                <td colspan="3"> Each are all very unique 3D spaces with many types of blocks used or crafted to become different resources for the player. Some 
                    blocks are affected by gravity such as Gravel and Sand which can be found in the Nether and Overworld, while most other blocks float. The overworld
                    is affected by a day/night cycle, while the Nether and End aren't since they are completely seperate pocket dimensions without a sun and moon. There
                    are many other factors that make each dimension similar and unique, and that's what makes it special: it <i> builds </i> on the resources, mobs and structures each player can find
                    creating a perfec sandbox game!</td>
