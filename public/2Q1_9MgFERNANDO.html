        <h2> Background to the 3 Dimensions:  </h2>
            <p> Minecraft has two pocket dimensions completely separate from your peaceful spawn place, the Overworld: 
                there is a land filled boiling lava known as the Nether, and galactic islands floating over a dark void called the End. </p>
        <h2> The Overworld </h2> 
            <article> 
                <h3> Biomes </h3>
                    <p> The Overworld contains a diverse number of biomes such as Taiga Forests, Ice Spikes, Dark Oak Forests,
                    Deserts and Jungles. </p>
                <h3> Structures </h3>
                    <p> There are also many structures such as Villages, Desert Temples, Igloos, Mansions and Jungle Temples. </p> 
                <h3> Ores </h3>
                    <p> Many resources are mined through ores such as Iron, Diamond, Emerald and Gold. </p>
                <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                    <p> While there are not any Main bosses in the Overworld, there are some optional sub-bosses due to their immense strength 
                        and high health points. These bosses include:
                        <ol> 
                            <li> <b> The Warden </b> </li> 
                            <p> Found in the Deep Dark is the Warden, a monster who relies on sound to find and destroy the player with
                                high damages smashes and a long ranged sonic boom that pierces through blocks, as well as being very durable. </p>
                            <li> <b> The Elder Guardian </b> </li> 
                            <p> On the other hand, the Elder Guardian is found in Ocean Monumments, protecting its treasures of gold blocks. 
                                It applies as special status effect- mining fatigue- on the player to reduce their speed in breaking blocks, as well as 
                                being able to shoot lasers from its eyes. </p>
                        </ol> 
            </article>

        <h2> The Nether </h2> 
            <article> 
                <h3> Background on The Nether </h3>
                    <p> The Nether can be accessed by building a nether portal in the overworld, creating a 4 block wide, 5 block tall 
                        outline of Obsidian and lighting it with a fire source, whether a fire charge, burning wood, or flint and steel. </p>
                <h3> Biomes </h3>
                    <p> The Nether also contains a diverse number of biomes such as Warped Forests, Crimson Forests, 
                        Basalt Deltas and Soul Sand Valleys. </p>
                <h3> Structures </h3>
                    <p> Some structures in the Nether include the Bastion Remnants and Nether Fortresses. </p> 
                <h3> Ores </h3>
                    <p> You can find Quartz Ores and Ancient Debris. </p>
                <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                    <p> While there are not any Main bosses in the Overworld, there are some optional sub-bosses due to their immense strength 
                        and high health points. These bosses include:
                        <ol> 
                            <li> <b> The Warden </b> </li> 
                            <p> Found in the Deep Dark is the Warden, a monster who relies on sound to find and destroy the player with
                                high damages smashes and a long ranged sonic boom that pierces through blocks, as well as being very durable. </p>
                            <li> <b> The Elder Guardian </b> </li> 
                            <p> On the other hand, the Elder Guardian is found in Ocean Monumments, protecting its treasures of gold blocks. 
                                It applies as special status effect- mining fatigue- on the player to reduce their speed in breaking blocks, as well as

                        </ol> 
            </article>

        <h2> The End </h2> 
            <article> 
                <h3> Background on The Nether </h3>
                    <p> The End Portal is accessed through the End Portal located in the Stronghold- underground dungeons with a room 
                        containing a 5x5 block portal- where you can place Eyes of Ender (a combination of Ender Pearls and Blaze Powder) 
                        to ignite a portal. </p>
                <h3> Biomes and Ores </h3>
                    <p> Compared to the previous dimensions, the End is quite bare since it only has two biomes- 
                        the Outer End and Main End Island, as well as not having any ores. </p>
                <h3> Structures </h3>
                    <p> Some structures in the Nether include the Bastion Remnants and Nether Fortresses. </p> 
                <h3> Bosses/Sub-bosses </h3>
                    <p> While there are not any Main bosses in the Overworld, there are some optional sub-bosses due to their immense strength 
                        and high health points. These bosses include:
                        <ol> 
                            <li> <b> The Warden </b> </li> 
                            <p> Found in the Deep Dark is the Warden, a monster who relies on sound to find and destroy the player with
                                high damages smashes and a long ranged sonic boom that pierces through blocks, as well as being very durable. </p>
                            <li> <b> The Elder Guardian </b> </li> 
                            <p> On the other hand, the Elder Guardian is found in Ocean Monumments, protecting its treasures of gold blocks. 
                                It applies as special status effect- mining fatigue- on the player to reduce their speed in breaking blocks, as well as

        title="JackBlack_TheNether" width = "160px" height = "210px">
        <p>   This is mainly because the Main End Island
            serves as the location of the final boss of Minecraft, the Ender Dragon, while the Outer End contains a single
            structure for players who want more content: the End City.
